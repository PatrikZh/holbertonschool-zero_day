# `In Git's Heart`

**GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. This tutorial teaches [GitHub](https://github.com/) essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. For more you can go [here](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_github.asp).**

**In order to setup git on your sandbox, your first step is going to be accessing the website and there will be an address of the form  (https://{your username}.github.io/{packagename}/), for example, the sandbox project is rendered at this address: https://sticsrpacks.github.io/sandbox/**

## `What is Branching?`


***In simple words, an Branch is a copy of a project, which you can edit and the changes don’t apply to the original project.***

***The git branch command can be used to create a new branch. When you want to start a new feature, you create a new branch off main using git branch new_branch. 
Once created, you can use git checkout new_branch to switch to that branch.***

## `How can we address conflicts?`

Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. For more information, see ''[About merge conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/about-merge-conflicts)''


`
Tip: You can use the conflict editor on GitHub to resolve competing line change merge conflicts between branches that are part of a pull request.
