For more you can go [here](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_github.asp).**

**In order to setup git on your sandbox, your first step is going to be accessing the website and there will be an address of the form  (https://{your username}.github.io/{packagename}/), for example, the sandbox project is rendered at this address: https://sticsrpacks.github.io/sandbox/**

## `What is Branching?`


***In simple words, an Branch is a copy of a project, which you can edit and the changes don’t apply to the original project.***

***The git branch command can be used to create a new branch. When you want to start a new feature, you create a new branch off main using git branch new_branch. 
Once created, you can use git checkout new_branch to switch to that branch.***
